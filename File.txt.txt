Peggy Johnson defines collection development as “the thoughtful process of 
developing a library collection in response to institutional priorities 
and community or user needs and interests” (Johnson 2009, p. 1). 
According to Johnson (2009, p. 1), collection development forms 
part of the broader concept of collection management, which involves
 “ an expanded suite of decisions 

about weeding, cancelling serials, storage, and preservation”. 
Traditional collection development involves selecting individual 
titles that will best meet the requirements of the library users. 
In an academic library environment, the selection of titles should
 primarily support the teaching, learning and research needs of the 
university staff, students and researchers (University of Western 
Australia Library 2015). However, the practice of bundling journal 
titles into one large all-encompassing package has meant that collection
 development decisions are now often made on a publisher level, rather than 
on a title-by-title basis (Ball, cited in Carlson & Pope 2009, p. 385). In this 
sense aggregator packages are similar in nature to monographic blanket orders, where
 a library agrees to purchase everything that a particular publisher has published 
(Thompson, Wilder & Button 2000, p. 214). The beauty of these large aggregator packages 
is that they allow library users to access a vast number of online scholarly resources 
through the click of a mouse button.
